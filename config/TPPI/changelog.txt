TPPIv0.3.0~
- Added Advanced Genetics! Adds genetic science to Minecraft. This replaces morph abilities. Fly as a squid or shear yourself as a bat, its up to you. Note: The auto output upgrade is disabled by default due to rare crashes.~
~~~
- Added ServerTools! No longer do you have to worry about world corruption and chunk resets. This mod will backup your game for you in the /backups folder in your Minecraft directory. This is disabled by default, and you will have to renable it and set the time intervals in the config.~
~~~
- The mod also works in SSP. This also adds a bunch of server commands and tools. Check the config for a complete listing.~
~
- Added Infernal Mobs! Adds some dangerous enemies, with Diablo-style enchantments.~
~~~
- Removed Mariculture. As you can see from the loading screen popup, mariculture was removed. Please remove all blocks and items (especially from your inventory) as we will not ship mariculture at all in the next version.~
~~~
- Removed LegacyCraft and Dragon API. The original purpose of this mod was to counteract the 1.6 zombie AI changes, which are (in testing) the #1 cause of server lag.~ ~~~
~~~
